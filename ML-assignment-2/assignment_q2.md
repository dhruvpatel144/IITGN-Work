The plot for the figure is in figures/Q2_Fig1. The dataset has been split into training(70%) and testing 30(%). The weigths for the 70% training samples have been assigned uniformly. We have used our implementation of decision tree as mentioned in the question.
Accuracy of the our weighted decision tree = 0.83
Accuracy of weighted sklearn decision tree  = 0.8666666666666667
